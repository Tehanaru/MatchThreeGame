** Match Three Game in Excel **

Created as a toy project to show VBA proficiency.

Works as a regular match three game. 
The player swaps two differently-colored cells and if a match is made, the matched cells are eliminated and more cells shift into place.

Scoring includes some bonus calculations to motivate more elaborate chain reactions.

Project is intended to demonstrate:
* Overall VBA proficiency.
* Use of buttons to trigger macros.
* Manipulation of multiple cells and updating data.
* Text / String processing. (Colors are created by assigning letters to cells and use of conditional formatting)
